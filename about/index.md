I am a bouncer turned programmer.  I wish I had a cooler origin story, one in which I get bitten by a radioactive Donald Knuth, but I do not.  I just always had an interest in technology which eventually turned into a fever for programming.  This fervor eventually brought me to the Flatiron School.  

Hopefully I can help others in my journey of learning to code with this blog.
